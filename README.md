# NCReactPortfolioTextParseService
TextParse service of my .NET Core and React portfolio, moving to a Kubernetes and Microservice approach.

In order to use this you will need a PAT with read package access to download the TextParse and SharedCS packages, however if I upload a PAT to Github it's automatically removed. To get around this you can either download these projects manually from the associated repositories, or send me a message/email to request a PAT.
